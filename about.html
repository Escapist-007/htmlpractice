		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>HTML practice was created by someone with too much time on their hands. This project was started 
		in early 2017, dedicated to creating actual projects that people can do to practice their HTML skills. 
		At the time that this was created, there was no site for just projects. This site is trying to fill in
		 that gap, and give people something to do. </p>
		 
		<h3>Learning Sources</h3>
		<p>This site was not made to teach people anything. If you do want to learn things, 
		<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css"> Khan Academy</a> has a 
		course that is an excellent introduction to these webpages. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/all">Codecademy</a> 
		also has an great selection of courses for learning, as does <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/learn/html-css">Code School</a>.
		 There are quite a few books in existence that will help you learn, so go over to your local library. Don't forget about 
		 Google!</p>
		
		<h3>Additional Credits</h3>
		<p>For the background used throughout the site, give <a href="http://www.heropatterns.com/">Hero Patterns</a> a round 
		of applause. For the framework that was used to help this site a bit, <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> was used. The font 
		used for this site was Raleway.  
		
		
		<br /> 
		<small>*why is the first credit for the background. just... why.</small></p>
		
		<h3>People Who Have Helped</h3>
		<p>If you've done something that helped this site in general, feel free to add your name! Adding in the project you did isn't 
		something that helped the site, though.</p>
